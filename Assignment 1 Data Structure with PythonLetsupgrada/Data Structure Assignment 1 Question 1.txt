Question 1
What is the time, space complexity of following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}
Answer 1 - The first loop is O(N) and the second loop is O(M). Since we donâ€™t know which is bigger, we say this is O(N + M). This can also be written as O(max(N, M)).
Since there is no additional space being utilized, the space complexity is constant / O(1).
